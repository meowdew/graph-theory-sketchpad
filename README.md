# Project - Graph Theory sketchpad

### Description

An interactive tool for visualizing and exploring graph theory concepts. Ideal for students, educators, and researchers in the field of computer science and mathematics. Create, manipulate, and analyze graphs in real-time with this user-friendly application.



#### What framework is being used in this project

1. `React` to create basic html 
2. `Tailwind css` to draw UI
3. `Electron` to create a cross-platform desktop application

#### Future work

1. Bug fix and necessary optimization
2. Web version
3. Maintenance and new features




##### Requirement Tracing

1. Required Functionality

  - Graphical display of vertices and edges
  - Input of vertices and edges
  - Able to reposition vertices while maintaining adjacencies
  - Deletion of vertices and edges
  - Parallel edges
  - Loops
  - Ability to color or label vertices

2. Recommended features:

  - Information about numbers of vertices and edges
  - Information about degrees of vertices
  - Display of directed arcs(for directed graphs)
  - Information about components
  - Show which edges are bridges
  - Show whether a graphic bipartite

3. Additional bonus features:

  - Adjacency matrix and/or Laplacian matrix info
  - Eigenvalues,eigenvectors for above
  - Quick Cartesian Product construction
  - Heuristics for minimal coloring/Chromatic numbers
  - Algorithms for 'pretty' drawings of graphs (cycles that automatically like cycles; grid )
  - Implementing well-known algorithms(Dijkstra's, Ford-Fulkerson, spanning tree construction, etc.)
  - Any other bells or whistles of your personal interest
