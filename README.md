# Project - Graph Theory sketchpad

### Description
This program is a functional program that enables teachers/students who are learning graph theory to draw their graphs to make it easy to understand the graph theory.
This program is built by Python and Qt UI, learn more here for QtPython:

##### Requirement Tracing
1. Required Functionality
  - Graphical display of vertices and edges
  - Input of vertices and edges
  - Able to reposition vertices while maintaining adjacencies
  - Deletion of vertices and edges
  - Parallel edges
  - Loops
  - Ability to color or label vertices
2. Recommended features:
  - Information about numbers of vertices and edges
  - Information about degrees of vertices
  - Display of directed arcs(for directed graphs)
  - Information about components
  - Show which edges are bridges
  - Show whether a graphis bipartite
3. Additional bouns features:
  - Adjacency matrix and/or Laplacian matrix info
  - Eigenvalues,eigenvectors for above
  - Quick Cartesian Product construction
  - Heuristics for minimal coloring/Chromatic nunbers
  - Algorithms for 'pretty' drawings of graphs (cycles that automaticallylook like cycles; grid )
  - Implementing well-known algorithms(Dijkstra's, Ford-Fulkerson, spanning tree construction, etc.)
  - Any other bells or whistles of your personal interest
